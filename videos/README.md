# Videos 
Some raw video material,
including short segments of "plugfest" demos that we can edit together into a "demo" video for a breakout session,
or a "WoT introduction" video.

These do not need to be final.  Please create an MD file with the same basename as the video explaining it.
Videos should be suitable for public distribution e.g. all rights and releases should have been obtained.
Please do not, for instance, use music you have not obtained the rights to.

Links to videos stored elsewhere are appropriate, especially for large video files.

Ideally final videos should have a voice-over and corresponding text overlay.
Ege's tutorial is a good example of the style that should be used, although we probably should add consistent
title and closing screens (e.g. following the Powerpoint template).

## Introductions
* [Short Introduction to WoT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt_P2BU8e3I)(1min)
## Implementations
* [Node-gen Node-RED autopopulation](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/master/events/2020.06.Online/prototypes/autopop.mp4)(2 mins): Learn how to use Node-RED and OpenJS Foundation supported node-gen tool to use Thing Descriptions to make orchestration without coding effort.
* Node-wot (to do)
## Tutorials
* [node-wot Getting Started tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDX45dsD4GM)(42 mins): A detailed guide on how to use the reference WoT Scripting API implementation Eclipse node-wot to program Things, Thing Consumers and WoT Mashups. Example code snippets can get you started right away.
## Tools
* WoT API Development Environment (WADE) [Short Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGPbl8Occjw)(5 mins)/ [Long Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb60fAE02GU)(15 mins): WADE is a desktop tool built with Electron and Vue.js that allows you to interact with WoT devices by parsing their TD. In this video, you can learn how to use the basic functionalities as well as the advanced timing benchmarking features. It is also available online at https://github.com/tum-esi/wade
* WAM - [video](https://youtu.be/bPxIfZo7jns). WAM is a CLI tool that helps newcomers to setup a WoT application project. The video explains the creation of a simple application using WAM and Node-WoT
* Frauhofer LinkSmart directories (to do)
* Mozilla WebThings (to do)
## Application
* [Thing Simulation and Proxying via Shadow Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp_bGMQnLzI)(17 mins): Using the [shadow-thing package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shadow-thing) you can simulate multiple Thing instances only with a TD or you can proxy real devices to change their protocol or reduce their load. 
## Use Cases
* Agriculture (to do)
* Smart City (to do)
* Smart Factory (to do)
